\b TIC TAC TOE \b

This is some python practice for me outside of the data science realm. I want to build my familiarity and
comfortability with python. The majority of this code was created simply by following the tutorial by Code
Coach from youtube. This can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK6gJw4-NCo

In his code, he creates a simple tic tac toe game in python and also then includes a computer player that 
makes moves by sampling random values from a uniform distribution.

I have not incorporated this computer element in yet. However, in addition to his code, I have built on
extra features for practice. I added the ability to play repeat games. I also included a score keeping
component that tracks scores for Player 1 and Player 2. For simplicity, Player 1 is always "X" and the
first turn will always alternate between X and 0s.
