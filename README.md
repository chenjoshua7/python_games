# Python Games

To better myself with Python, I am coding some simple games into Python.

## TIC TAC TOE

This is some python practice for me outside of the data science realm. I want to build my familiarity and
comfortability with python. The majority of this code was created simply by following the tutorial by Code
Coach from youtube. This can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK6gJw4-NCo

However, I added many elements to this game including the ability to keep track of game scores and the ability 
to play multiple games, as well as taking care of some issues with the tutorial code.

I have created a PvP game as well as a PvC version of the game.

## GREEDY PIG

This is a probability game that I loved to play with my students when I was teaching high school math.
The rules of the game are very simple. You roll keep rolling a dice. Whatever number you get is added to 
your score. However, if you roll a 1, your score drops to 0. You can play the game with multiple people 
and play multiple rounds. Winner is who has the most points at the end of all the round.

This game I coded completely from scratch. My next step for this game will be to allow this to be for multiple 
players.

## Blackjack

I am challenging myself with a more involved game. I briefly skimmed https://gist.github.com/mjhea0/5680216 for
some inspiration but this was largely done by scratch. I implemented a betting system and made the text more
engaging.

Ideas to build upon this game are:
1. Insurance
2. Splitting
3. Doubling Down
4. Multiple Players
5. Cards including sutis
6. Multiple decks
